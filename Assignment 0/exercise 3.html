  <p>Time is more precious than money is.</p>
</div>


<div class="justify-align">
  <p>Once the money is used, it can be earned again, but the time which has passed will never return. We all must have heard the famous proverb, ‘Time and Tide wait for none.’ Time never waits for anyone or anything. In fact, we have to wait for the perfect time</p>
</div>

<div class="left-align">
  <p>There is a perfect time for everything; therefore, think about how precious it is, and utilise it ideally before time fails. People say money can buy everything, but money can never buy time for you.</p>
</div>

<div class="center-align">
  <p>So, understand the value of time and use it wisely.</p>
</div>
